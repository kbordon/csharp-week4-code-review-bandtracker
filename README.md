## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Enter the URL: https://github.com/kbordon/csharp-week4-code-review-bandtracker in your browser.
* Using your terminal or powershell, clone this repository by typing ```>git clone https://github.com/kbordon/csharp-week4-code-review-bandtracker.git```
    * Alternatively, you can use a browser to download the .zip file from the Github web interface at the URL: https://github.com/kbordon/csharp-week4-code-review-bandtracker.git
* To look at project code, navigate to the project folder csharp-week4-code-review-bandtracker, and use a text editor like Atom to open the README.md.
* For any use of the application, make sure you have [.NET Core 1.1 SDK (Software Development Kit)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/F/4/F/F4FCB6EC-5F05-4DF8-822C-FF013DF1B17F/dotnet-dev-win-x64.1.1.4.exe) and [.NET runtime](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/F/B/6FB4F9D2-699B-4A40-A674-B7FF41E0E4D2/dotnet-win-x64.1.1.4.exe) both installed.
* To test the application:
  * First ensure you have the proper database setup by entering starting up MySql, and entering the following commands:
  ```SQL
  > CREATE database band_tracker_test;
  > USE band_tracker;
  > CREATE TABLE venues (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR (255), city VARCHAR (255), capacity INT);
  > CREATE TABLE bands (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR (255), popularity INT);
  > CREATE TABLE gigs (band_id INT, venue_id INT);
  ```
  * Using powershell or terminal, navigate to the folder named csharp-week4-code-review-bandtracker. Then enter the following commands:
  ```
  >cd csharp-week4-code-review-bandtracker
  >cd BandTracker.Tests
  >dotnet restore
  >dotnet test
  ```
  * You can view the tests code by using your powershell or terminal in the HairSalon.Tests folder, then typing ```>cd Model.Tests``` and then ```> atom .``` to open both the tests on the Stylist and Client classes. If you don't have Atom, use whichever text editor you have available.

* To run the application:
  * First, you must have the proper database setup by following these commands:
  ```SQL
  > CREATE database band_tracker;
  > USE band_tracker;
  > CREATE TABLE venues (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR (255), city VARCHAR (255), capacity INT);
  > CREATE TABLE bands (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR (255), popularity INT);
  > CREATE TABLE gigs (band_id INT, venue_id INT);
  ```
  * Using powershell or terminal, navigate to the folder named csharp-week4-code-review-bandtracker. Then enter the following commands:
  ```
  >cd csharp-week4-code-review-bandtracker
  >cd BandTracker
  >dotnet restore
  >dotnet run
  ```
  * Then, on your browser, go to the URL address: localhost:5000 or, whichever server your app might be running on.
  * Use the buttons, and forms to navigate the app.
  * Once you're finished, close the browser and turn off the server by entering <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on your powershell or terminal.

## Known Bugs
* If entering a name that has a special character such as "$", word will be not be capitalized correctly (Example: "a$ap ferg" becomes "A$AP Ferg")
* Venues on a band's venue list, and vice-versa can be listed multiple times, which seems unnecessary. Would like to go back either make the query return only the first of each relationship, or attach additional information field, like date of the gig.
